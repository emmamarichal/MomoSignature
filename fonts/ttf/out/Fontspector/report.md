     listed below may simply indicate a significantly different
     design on some of your glyphs. On the other hand, some of these
     may flag actual bugs in the font such as glyphs mapped to an
     incorrect codepoint. Please consider reviewing the design and
     codepoint assignment of these to make sure they are correct.
